An M3U generator for plex using the same scraping logic as piptv!

To generate the m3u, make sure you have the directory set to where you would like it to
appear in the config/config.properties file.

For example, if you wanted it to be written to /home/m3u_folder and to be called
test.m3u, change the line in the config.properties so that it reads:

```
dir=/home/m3u_folder/test.m3u
```

Other than that, you just run the script, and the file is generated!
